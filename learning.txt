commad in windows to get list of files in a folder(make sure to be in the correct path)
    1. dir - list out all files not hidden files
    2. dir /a:h - list out all hidden files

Git Configuration Commands:
    git config --global user.name "<userName>":
        1. sets your name
    git config --global user.email "<email>":
        1. sets your mail

 Repository Management Commands:
    git init: 
        1. It creates a new hidden .git directory inside the project folder. 
        2. This .git directory contains all the metadata, including commit history, branches, configurations, and objects.
        3. objects/ → Stores all commits, trees, and blobs.
        refs/ → Contains references to branches and tags.
        logs/ → Keeps logs of changes in branches.

    git status:
        1. The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area.
        2. It tells you if there are untracked, modified, or staged files.
        3. It helps you see what changes are ready to be committed.
        4. It shows which branch you are on.

    3. git log:
        1. shows the history of changes that made 

Staging & Committing Commands:
    git add <fileName>:
        1. Tracks new files: If a file is newly created, git add makes Git recognize it.
        2.command "git add ." tracks all files

    git commit -m "<msg you need to print>":

        Command	                        Staging Required?	        Notes
        git commit -m "msg"	                ✅ Yes	        Must stage first (git add)
        git commit -am "msg"	            ❌ No	        Works only for modified/deleted files

Undoing & Resetting Commands:
    git reset <id>:
        1. removes the commits that are above the that id mentioned.
        2. it has modes: --soft, --mixed, --hard

    git stash: 
        1. git stash temporarily saves your uncommitted changes so you can work on something else without losing your progress.
        git stash -> Save uncommitted changes
        git stash list -> View saved stashes
        git stash apply	-> Restore last stash (keeps stash in the list)
        git stash pop -> Restore last stash and remove it from the list
        git stash drop stash@{0} -> Delete a specific stash
        git stash clear -> Delete all stashes

Remote Repository Management:
    git remote add <remoteName> <remote URL>:
        1. The git remote add command links your local Git repository to a remote repository(like gitHub) so you can push and pull changes.
            <remoteName> → A short alias for the remote repository (commonly origin).
            <remoteURL> → The URL of the remote repository (HTTPS or SSH).
        Command	                                        Purpose
        git remote -v	                        Show all remote repositories linked to the project
        git remote remove <remoteName>	        Remove a remote repository
        git remote rename <oldName> <newName>	Rename a remote repository alias
        git remote show <remoteName>	        Show details about a specific remote
    
    git push <remoteName> <branch>:
        Command	                                                Purpose
        git push origin main	                    Pushes main branch to origin
        git push -u origin main	                    Pushes & sets upstream tracking for main
        git push origin --delete feature-branch	    Deletes feature-branch from the remote repo
        git push --force origin main	            Forces push (overwrites remote history)
    
    git pull:
        Command	                                                Description
        git pull	                            Fetches and merges changes from the remote repository into the current branch.
        git pull origin main	                Pulls the latest changes from the main branch of the remote repository origin.
        git pull origin <branchName>	        Pulls the latest changes from the <branchname> branch.
        git pull --rebase origin master         Pulls the latest changes from GitHub and applies your local commits on top of them.
    
    Difference between pull and push:
        Command	                    Purpose	                                Direction	            Usage

                                remote repository to your local branch.
        git push	            Uploads local commits to a remote   	Local → Remote	        git push origin main
                                repository.

Branching and Merging:
    Branch:
        A branch in Git is like a separate line of development.
        1. The default branch is called main (or master in older versions).
        2. You can create multiple branches to work on different features or fixes.
        3. Branches help in parallel development without interfering with the main code.
        4. Ex: crating separate branches for different features(like login, booking ....etc).
    
    git branch: shows the current branch we are working in
    git branch <branchName>: crates a new branch with branch name specified
    git checkout <branchName>: This switches you to the specified branch. (i.e, head points to that brach the 
                               changes we make do reflect in main project). can use git swithch <branchName>
    git checkout -b <branchName> or git switch -c <branch>: creates and switches to that beanch
    git branch -d <branchName>: deletes that branch locally
    git push origin --delete <branch-name>: delete form remote repository
    git branch -a: list out all branches

Work Flow of pushing local commits to remote repo:
        Step	        Command
    Check branch	    git branch
    Check status	    git status
    Stage changes	    git add .
    Commit changes	    git commit -m "Your message"
    Push changes	    git push origin <branch-name>

Work flow of merging branches:
    Step	                        Command
    Check branches	                git branch
    Pull latest changes	            git pull origin main
    Switch to the target branch	    git checkout main or git switch main
    Merge the feature branch	    git merge feature-branch
    Resolve conflicts	Fix manually, then git add . and git commit -m "Resolved conflicts"
    Push merged changes	            git push origin main
    Delete the merged branch	    git branch -d feature-branch (local), git push origin --delete feature-branch (remote)
